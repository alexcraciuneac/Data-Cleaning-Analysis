I used the database from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022
Where i cleaned the unnecessary data, i standardized the data and remove the unused NULL and blank values
After i finished the data cleaning i started to explore and interpret the data from this database to see the companies with the most layoffs, the years with the most layofss and companies that reach the banckruptcy in "Exploratory Data Analysis" query.
